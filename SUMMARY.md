## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
1. **Lazy Initialization:** All services use lazy `get_db()` and `get_publisher()` to prevent cold start crashes
2. **Error Handling:** Try/except blocks on all routes with JSON error responses
3. **Logging:** Comprehensive structured logging for debugging
4. **Pub/Sub Normalization:** All services accept both push format and direct JSON
5. **Base64 Decoding:** Proper handling of Pub/Sub message encoding
6. **Startup Diagnostics:** All services log routes, PORT, and environment on startup

### Operational Excellence
1. **Gen2 Execution Environment:** Better performance and reliability
2. **Proper Resource Allocation:** CPU/memory/GPU configured per service
3. **Traffic Routing:** Force latest revision deployment
4. **Health Checks:** All services expose `/healthz`
5. **Service Identity:** All services expose `GET /` with service name
6. **Environment Variables:** `GCP_PROJECT` set on all services

### Security
1. **OIDC Authentication:** Pub/Sub subscriptions use service account with minimal permissions
2. **IAM Roles:** Proper `roles/run.invoker` binding
3. **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Environment variables for configuration
